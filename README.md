# InsuredsPortal
Angular Application for Portfolio

Software focused toward engagement with the end user, in this case the Insured. This application allows the Insured to access important information about their Claim, Policy, and the Adjuster who will be working their claim. Via connection with UScope's PhotoID app, we've added the ability for the Insured to connect directly with the Adjuster via Remote connection. This allows incorporates AI, CoreLogic, to identify Damages automatically. Additionally, this application allows a user to fill out their Personal Property damages. This data is automatically loaded, saved, and stored within the server without any manipulation by the user. This is achieved by opening a connection to the server via HttpClient, converting the data from an HTML Table to an XLSX file, and then perform a get/put to/from the server.


The skills utilized for this project are, but not limited to: Angular 10, PhotoID App, Angular Material, Typescript, HTML, CSS and the SheetJS library.
